<<FORMULA START>>The patient's estimated due date based on their last menstrual period and cycle length is computed by using Naegele's Rule. Using Naegele's Rule, we add 40 weeks to the patient's last menstrual period date. We then add or subtract days from the patient's estimated due date depending on how many more or less days a patient's cycle length is from the standard 28 days.<<FORMULA END>>
